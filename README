Data preparation
#############

1. It is supposed that the home folder is ./, and the sequencing files determined by sequencing analyzer were put in the fold ./raw/. so they are
fastq file: ./raw/PhIPseq_R1.fastq.gz
index file: ./raw/PhIPseq_I1.fastq.gz
barcode file: ./raw/Sample-Barcode.txt

2. The splitted fastq files would be stored into the directory ~/phip/PhIP-seq_Analyzer/test_rawdata/

3. The running mode would be phipseq analysis mode, so the output folders would be ./test_human and ./test_virus. So the last parameter should be -y ./test

4. enter the folder known as PhIP-seaq_Analyzer
##############
1: Demultiplex FASTQ file
#############

Example 1: Mostly used function involves demultiplexing and generating sample_info.csv and variables.txt run the command line like the below:

#python ./bin/bioTreatFASTQ.py -i ./raw/PhIPseq_I1.fastq.gz -f ./raw/PhIPseq_R1.fastq.gz -b ./raw/Sample-Barcode.txt -o ./test_rawdata/ -y ./test

Once the proceduce is done, some folders and files would be created: There would be many fastq files in ./test_rawdata/, and the file names would be determined by the barcode file.
The folders known as ./test_human and ./test_virus would be created, of which has sample_info.csv and variables.txt

Note: the pipeline only accept the absolute path of a directory or file

Example 2:  trim nucleotides when demultiplexing, for example
trim 10nt from 3-end:      					-t 0:10
trim 5nt from 5-end and 10nt from 3-end:  	-t 5:10

So the command would like:
#python ./bin/bioTreatFASTQ.py -t 0:50 -i ./raw/PhIPseq_I1.fastq.gz -f ./raw/PhIPseq_R1.fastq.gz -b ./raw/Sample-Barcode.txt -o ./test_rawdata/ -y ./test

Example 3: Demultiplexing step can be skipped, and directly get sample_info.csv and variables.txt. Here *.fastq files were stored at ./test_rawdata/

# python ./bin/bioTreatFASTQ.py -o ./test_rawdata/ -y ./test

Example 4: skip demultiplexing step, and trim fastq reads

# python ./bin/bioTreatFASTQ.py -t 0:50 -x ./test_raw/ -o ./test_rawdata/ -y ./test

Here, all fastq files were put in the ./test_raw/, and the trimmed fastq files (remove 50nt from 3-end of each read) were saved into ./test_rawdata/

################
About barcode file
###################
1. barcode file should be *.txt. The first and second columns should be barcode sequences and sample names, respectively.
2.Regarding sample names, avoid some characters namely slash(/ or \), * @ or white space. And the character -, _ . is ok.
3. No while line is allowed.

ERROR Handling
########################
ERROR 1: Mac OS X: ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8 in Python
Resolution: If you have faced the error on MacOS X, here's the quick fix - add these lines to your ~/.bash_profile:
	export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
	export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
end then reload bash_profile: 
	# source ~/.bash_profile
